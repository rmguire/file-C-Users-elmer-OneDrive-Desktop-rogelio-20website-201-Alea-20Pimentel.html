<h1>To Alea Pimentel,</h1>

<section>
<h2>Welcome to your personalized Website!!! I'm sorry if you had to copy the link for this, but I couldn't figure out how to turn this into a URL yet.</h2>
<h3>I spent quite a while making this but <em>don't feel like it's a burden to me</em> as I told myself maybe this part of the gift can also help me in finding new hobbies or interests. Thank you for being a large and important part of 2023 for me! :DD</h3>

<P> I know you may be asking why I went through all the effort to do this, but simply this is just a really big and less expensive gift to you before the year ends as I know you never liked it when I spent money on you so this was the next best thing I could have done for you. Don't worry, I've also made a website for Jan and some other friends so it's all fair really, anyway I just wanted to make this as another part of your gift and I hope you enjoy the layout of the website!!<b> Have a merry christmas and a very happy new year!</b> </p> </section>
